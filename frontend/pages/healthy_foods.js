<section>
    <p>Depending on whom you ask, “healthy eating” may take any number of forms. It seems that everyone, including healthcare professionals, wellness influencers, coworkers, and family members, has an opinion on the healthiest way to eat.
        Plus, nutrition articles that you read online can be downright confusing with their contradictory — and often unfounded — suggestions and rules.
        This does not make it easy if you simply want to eat in a healthy way that works for you.
        The truth is, healthy eating does not have to be complicated. It is entirely possible to nourish your body while enjoying the foods you love.
        After all, food is meant to be enjoyed — not feared, counted, weighed, and tracked.
        This article cuts through the noise to explain what healthy eating means and how to make it work for you.</p>
